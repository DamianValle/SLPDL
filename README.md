# Speech and Language Processing for Deep Learning

Collection of jupyter notebooks using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) that cover the following topics:

### word2vec skipgram model

- corpus loading
- data preparation
- torch implementation of the skipgram model
- neural network training
- embedding exploration

### LSTM Language Models

- data preprocessing using [sacremoses](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder)
- LSTM language model implementation
- inference task with context (both greedy and sampling implementations)

### Speech Classification

- dataset: [Free Spoken Digit Dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)
- compute mel-spectrograms with [librosa](https://librosa.org/)
- CNN training and evaluation
